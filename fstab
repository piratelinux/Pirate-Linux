# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't 
# needed); notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage 
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to 
# switch between notail / tail freely.

# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.

# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
